| Example | Bad prompt | Improved prompt | Why it helps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | “Write some code to process a list.” | “Write a Python function `filter_and_sum(numbers, threshold)` that filters values >= `threshold`, sums them, and returns the result. Show an example call.” | Specifies language, function name, exact behavior, and desired example output. |
| 2 | “What’s wrong with this data file?” | “Analyze the JSON file `sales.json` and list entries missing the `region` field or having negative `revenue`. Provide the count for each issue.” | Limits scope (specific fields/issues) so the assistant does not guess irrelevant problems. |
| 3 | “Help me with a product description for a gadget.” | “Act as a marketing writer and craft a 3-paragraph description for a Bluetooth speaker emphasizing portability and battery life. Include a bulleted benefits list.” | Adds persona, output structure, and key values so the response is aligned with expectations. |
| 4 | “Debug this script—it’s not working.” | “Review the attached Python log; identify the exact exception line and explain whether it’s caused by an `IndexError` or invalid input, then propose a precise fix for the root collection logic.” | Points to data, isolates the error, and asks for an actionable fix so the assistant focuses on concrete debugging steps instead of guessing. |
| 5 | “Transform the dataset.” | “Convert the CSV into a parquet file with columns renamed as follows: `user_id` → `customer_id`, `date` → `order_date`; drop rows where `status` is `cancelled`. Return a shell command or short script.” | Adds the target format, renaming map, filtering rule, and desired output form so the assistant can deliver a usable pipeline snippet. |
